# olympic-pipeline-sql

* [Part 1: Coding](coding/README.md): The Python in this repo is developed in version 3.9.13. The PostgreSQL database is version 15
* [Part 2: SQL](sql/README.md): The SQL in this exercise uses Snowflake syntax

## Reproducibility

### Docker

A docker container is not included at this time. This would have been a nice to have to ensure consistency and simplify setup.

### SQL

The PostreSQL database developed in part 1 is locally hosted and can be downloaded directly from [PostgreSQL's website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or installed with Homebrew or Chocolatey, either on Mac or Windows respectively.

### Python

This repository includes a `requirements.txt` to install any necessary packages to run the python script. `juptyer` is an optional package to provide an interactive notebook interface to run or debug the python script.
